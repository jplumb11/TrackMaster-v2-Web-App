# TrackMaster-v2-Web-App
Simple IoT project by Adnan Memic, Joshua Plumb and Jamie Taylor-Bagnall
Trackmaster is a website application that allows users to view a map of their routes, locations and journeys, and can be filtered for example by date, so the user can see the data they desire. 
It also allows users to create an account using their personal and physical information. This data is held in a database, and along with their location tracking data gained passively through Owntracks, the system is able to output advanced statistics using their physical information (i.e. weight) such as calories, averages, distances and the routes they have travelled. This helps the user to improve their lifestyle and fitness level by giving a clear representation of their current level, their habits and the commonly visited locations.
